# Development Setup

This project contains two sections, the frontend and backend. The frontend can run standalone however if you want the functionailites for the website you will need setup the backend as well.

For convience we have hard coded some data so you can see what the frontend looks like given that the user has data imported.

**NOTE: You need to have nodejs and npm installed.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tuann72/clutter-free.git
```

Step 2: Change directory into the frontend folder.

cd frontend
```

Step 3: Install frontend dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```

npm run dev
```
